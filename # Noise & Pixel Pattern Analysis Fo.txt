# Noise & Pixel Pattern Analysis Forensic Tool

## Overview

The **Noise & Pixel Pattern Analysis Forensic Tool** is a digital image forensics application designed to analyze noise characteristics and pixel-level patterns to assess image authenticity.  
It applies established forensic techniques to detect manipulation, recompression, resampling artifacts, and inconsistencies that may indicate synthetic or altered imagery.

This tool is intended for research, academic study, cybersecurity investigations, and digital forensics workflows.
